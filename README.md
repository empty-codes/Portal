Summary
_____________
A website that allows users which are students register and then login to input their personal details and university level and then select courses accordingly and register for the semester. The students can also access their results for their registered courses and see their GPA and also be able to print a course form.

There should also be a separate portal for lecturers to input the scores for the students that have registered to their courses.

2. Be shown a list of courses 
3. Be able to choose the courses to register from the list
4. Print course form i.e a list of courses

6. The GPA of each student is calculated according to a grading scale
